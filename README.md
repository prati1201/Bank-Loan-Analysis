# OBJECTIVE 
   + The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer will have difficulty paying their installments.
   + This information can be used to make decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants.
   + The company wants to understand the key factors behind loan default so it can make better decisions about loan approval.
